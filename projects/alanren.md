# ml5.js Website Functionality Enhancement and Examples with Built-in Editor

## Abstract

This project aims to enhance the ml5.js website by improving its design, performance, and functionality using React with Gatsby. A key feature is the introduction of a compact, built-in editor that allows users to interact with and modify code examples in real-time. This enhancement is expected to provide a more interactive and engaging user experience, making it easier for beginners to learn and experiment with ml5.js. The project is anticipated to centralize resources, streamline the learning process, and showcase the capabilities of ml5.js more effectively.

## Objectives

1. **Improve Website Design and Performance:** Utilize React with Gatsby to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the ml5.js website.
2. **Centralize Learning Resources:** Integrate documentation, video tutorials, and examples into a cohesive user experience.
3. **Introduce Interactive Code Editor:** Embed a live, interactive code editor to allow real-time coding and testing directly on the website.
4. **Empower Learners:** Provide an enriched learning environment for beginners and facilitate easier access to learning materials.
5. **Showcase ml5.js Capabilities:** Create a gallery view of examples demonstrating the practical applications of ml5.js.

## References

- Existing ml5.js website structure and content.
- User feedback on the current ml5.js website experience.
