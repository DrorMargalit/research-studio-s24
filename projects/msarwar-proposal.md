# Contributing to ml5.js: Increasing Accessibility

#### By Myrah Sarwar

## Abstract

This project aims to improve the readability and presentation of the ml5.js documentation on the website. More generally, this would be achieved by standardizing language and formatting of written content across reference pages and by making accessibility modifications. Preliminary research suggests that some target areas should include reorganizing instructions, rewriting for brevity, and adjusting text alternatives where necessary.

The final project will present a content analysis and recommended changes to current pages, with examples of updated versions of the “Getting Started” and "Bodypose" pages. By creating a greater sense of clarity and consistency, the ml5.js documentation would be more approachable so that users can better digest the information when learning.

## Objectives

The goals are to:

- Reduce the learning curve by making the documentation easier to understand.
- Increase accessibility by accommodating a larger range of learning needs.

## References

- **[AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/)**: This is a guide that is widely used and often required in journalism and mass communication. It offers a set of rules to follow to ensure that all writing for larger audiences (including any written content on the web) is uniform, clear, and easy to read. I don’t intend to completely follow these as the nature of this assignment is slightly different, but I may occasionally reference it for best practices regarding sentence structure and clarity, as well as to avoid bias and assumptions of the reader.

- **[Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)**: Similarly, this lays out best practices in writing and formatting content online to be more accessible. I may reference this when considering which changes need to be made in the instructions and organization of information.

## Methodology

Through preliminary research and analysis of the reference pages on the ml5.js next-generation in-progress website, I noticed and plan to address these recurring issues:

- **Inconsistencies across language and formatting**: Some code examples have well-written comments that are descriptive while others do not, and some pages have steps clearly laid out in order or numbered while others do not.

- **Unclear or confusing instructions**: Redundancy, insufficient details where beneficial, and use of complex language without proper context.

- **Not enough consideration for accessibility**: Poor link descriptions (e.g., “click here”) and some images are missing alternative text.

While it is too large of a task to correct all of these for the entire website (at least for the scope of this project), it is possible to lay out a set of guidelines and shared vocabulary in how ml5.js features are defined and explained. As several ml5.js models don’t yet have pages, these guidelines can not only be used in current pages but also in the future for the description of other features so that there is consistency as the new website continues to be further developed.

For the purpose of this project, I will be focusing on the “Getting Started” and “Bodypose” pages specifically and proposing adjustments to those, with the intent that these can then be adapted for other pages as well.

## Final Deliverable

The final presentation will include a more thorough analysis of areas of the current ml5.js next-generation website that can be improved, propose a set of recommended guidelines to follow to correct these, and give examples of updated pages for “Getting Started” and ”Bodypose” to show how these might be implemented.

- **Feb 28 - Mar 6**: Using the results from completed research and analysis, create a set of guidelines for content style and consistency for the website.

- **Mar 6 - Mar 13**: Start constructing proposed updated versions of “Getting Started” and “Bodypose” pages.

- **[Spring break]**

- **Mar 27 - Apr 3**: Continue working on updated versions of pages.
